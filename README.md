## Use It

It is worth noting that, content of the website is open for customizing and editing as you want.

As You see, I have kept the structure as simple as possible to have an organized component and data list.
In src directory “components” folder consists all the essential components, furthermore “data” folder consists some json files which will be injected to components dynamically.  
Therefore, you can put your own data into Data files easily, to have a personal website immediately.

## Hope you enjoy it.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any feedback or question.
That would be my pleasure to hear any suggestion and feedback from you
